# Bird-strikes-Dashboard

This repository contains a detailed analysis and visualization of bird strikes on aircraft. This  dashboard provides insights into the patterns of bird strikes, including which airlines and airports are most affected, the phases of flight during which bird strikes occur, and the costs associated with bird strikes.

# Key Features:

Number of Bird Strikes by Year: A steady rise in bird strikes from 2000 to 2010, with a notable peak in 2009.

Top 10 US Airlines by Bird Strikes: Analysis of which airlines face the highest number of bird strikes, with SouthWest Airlines leading.

Top 50 Airports by Bird Strikes: Dallas Fort Worth and other large airports report the most bird strikes.

Phase of Flight and Altitude Data: Bird strikes predominantly occur during the approach phase of flights(around 40%), and most strikes happen below 100 feet in altitude.

Cost Analysis: The yearly cost incurred by bird strikes varies significantly, with some years experiencing costs over $12 million.

In most cases, pilots received no prior warning of the bird strike, and most strikes did not cause damage. However, a small proportion of strikes caused significant damage when no warning was given.

# Tools Used:

Power BI: For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib): For data cleaning, analysis, and initial visualizations.
